LESS CSS Processor for ColdFusion Builder
============

This extension was written at the cf.Objective() 2012 ColdFusion conference.
Following a presentation on LESS CSS from Nathan Strutz, I wanted to create an easy way to process LESS files from any ColdFusion Builder project location.

This extension will process and convert the files into production-ready .css files ready for deployment. It retains the original .less files for continual development.
